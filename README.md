## WikidataExport

This is the sister code of the [r-wikidata-bot](https://github.com/reactome/r-wikidata-bot) and creates the required json files from the Reactome Graph Database.

## Code

The code is written in Java and uses the [Graph Database](http://www.reactome.org/pages/documentation/developer-guide/graph-database/) and corresponding API. 


### Arguments

The following arguments are required

```console
-h "host"      The neo4j host for the ReactomeDB
-b "port"      The neo4j port
-u "user"      The neoj4 username
-p "password"  The neo4j password
-o "outputdirectory"    The directory where output files will be written
```

### Output

Five json files are written:
- pathway.json : has all the pathways
- reaction.json : has all the reactions
- physicalEntity.json : has all the physical entities
- modifiedProtein.json : has all the modified proteins
- parent.json : has all the child-parent links


These files are read in by the sister code r-wikidata-bot and used to populate/update Reactome data in Wikidata.

### Current Functionality and Limitations
- The code currently only exports top level pathways (and their children) belonging to the Homo sapiens species

- The code exports Pathway, ReactionLikeEvent, Complex & EntitySet and modified proteins (EntityWithAccessionedSequence 
that have modified residues) as Reactome entities in the files pathway.json, reaction.json, physicalEntity.json and modifiedProtein.json 
respectively.

- The above entities may have children / parts that are not exported as Reactome entities. So for example, 
a Complex could have a SimpleEntity as a component, an EntitySet could have an EntityWithAccessionedSequence
without modified residues, or a Drug as a member. Modified proteins have modified residues that donâ€™t belong
to Reactome database. Currently, the code for the project can handle and link to such parts / children where 
the external database is UniProt or ChEBI, provided that part from a non-Reactome source already exists in Wikidata. 
This then includes SimpleEntity and EntityWithAccessionedSequence without modified residues where the ChEBI and UniProt
identifiers are specified

- The fifth file parent.json records child-parent links allowing each Reactome entry in Wikidata to be linked back to its
parents

- The code doesn't currently support export of Drug, Polymer, and OtherEntity

- The code exports `components` as parts of complexes, `members` as parts of the entity set
  and modified residues falling under `TranslationalModification` and `ReplacedResidue` as parts of modified proteins. 
  `candidates` for CandidateSet, and other types of modified residues are not being exported

### Prerequisites

- [Reactome Graph Database](http://www.reactome.org/dev/graph-database/) must be up and running before executing 
the wikidata-exporter


#### Export data from Reactome

1. Cloning and packaging the wikidata-exporter project

```
git clone https://github.com/reactome/wikidata-exporter.git
cd wikidata-exporter
mvn clean package
```

2. Generating .json files

```
mkdir data
java -jar target/wikidata-exporter-jar-with-dependencies.jar -h localhost -b 7474 -u user -p not4share -o data
```

This step may take up to 10 minutes.

3. Verification

The specified outputdirectory should have the 5 json files mentioned above.

The wikidata-exporter/WikidataExporter.log file has the logs for the project.
